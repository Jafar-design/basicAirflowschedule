Problem 1
=========
This project is intended to design a schedule that writes a datetime expression every minute. The main file where the dag is written is the 'mydaggy.py' file in the dags folder. Kindly ignore other python files. 

The problem I face is, I expect the datetime expression to write into the 'wr1.txt' file, as specified in my python code. This airflow guy doesn't do this upon running my code. It did show that the dag ran in my Airflow UI, but I cannot find the written expression in the 'wr1.txt' file.

Thank you.
